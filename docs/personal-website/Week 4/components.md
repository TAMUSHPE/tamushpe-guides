# ‚úÇÔ∏è Copying + Pasting Footer

First things first, please ensure that all the links on your nav bar AND footer work properly *or else you're just going to struggle more, trying to find where you went wrong*.

Second things second, make sure that up to now, you have pushed all of your changes. You can check by launching a live server ([instructions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) on one tab, and going to your GitHub link on the other tab, *username*.github.io :) If it looks and works exactly the same, you can follow the next steps.

If you are not familiar with keyboard shortcuts on MACOS and WindowsOS, here is a helpful little graphic that will ultimately make your life easier, not just with this website assignment.

Now, we proceed.

## Selecting the footer

<!-- 
It should now look somewhat like this:
