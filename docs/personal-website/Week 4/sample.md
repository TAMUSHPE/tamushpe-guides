# 🤯  Week 4 🤯

## Topics & Components

By now, you should have your website up and running-- at least the home page *as of now*. This week will be a bit short, more to the point due to dividing the about page into two. Most of your changes should be within your ```about.html``` file.

### 🙆🏽‍♀️ Copying the Components

- Copying footer from the home/index page

### 👤 About

- Has a summarized description of you (don't make it an essay)

### 🎠 Image Carousel
