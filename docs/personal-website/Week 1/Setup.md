## ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloads

### VSCode

1. Download Visual Studio Code (you can use any coding platform you want to build your website but I personally like this one) here's a link to download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Create a folder in your computer where your website files will go under
3. Install the following add ons on Visual Studio Code:
        1. Bootstrap 4, Font awesome 4, Font Awesome 5 Free & Pro snippets
        2. C/C++
        3. HTML Boilerplate
        4. HTML CSS Support
        5. HTML Snippets
        6. IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML
        7. Live Server

### Github Desktop

1. If you haven't already, [create a github account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
2. Once you created your github account, [install Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your respective operating system (OS: *MAC, Windows, Linux, etc*)
3. Once you finish setting GHD up, [create a new repository](https://github.com/new), name it *username*.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. **Please double check it is your username, it will not work if misstyped**
4. Quick setup option: select **Setup in Desktop**, make sure to route the Local Path, preferably, to your desktop for easier access. 
5. It should now look like this **TODO: Insert snapshot**
