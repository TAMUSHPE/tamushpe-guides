# Submitting Deliverables

![Google Drive](/img/shpeathon-submission.jpeg)

## File Upload

Throughout the course of the competition, several deliverables will need to be submitted. Each team will have their own folder inside of a shared google drive that they will need to upload completed files to. Be sure to follow the naming instructions for your files so we know what's what.

<!-- FIXME: Change link -->

Use this Google Drive link to upload your files: [https://tech.tamushpe.org/docs/shpeathon/event-details/submitting_deliverables](https://tech.tamushpe.org/docs/shpeathon/event-details/submitting_deliverables)

**Make sure to submit your deliverables on time!**
