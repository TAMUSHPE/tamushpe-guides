## Product Planning

Research different types of documents that will help your team brainstorm ideas. **Choose one and digitally submit this document via the Google Drive.** Examples include:
   1. Mind Map type of document
   2. Be creative and create your own
   3. Anything else that conveys ideas & thought process

## Description of Product

**Add a brief description of your product in a seperate section, make sure to mention what makes it sustainable, inclusive, and ethical.**

1. Sustainability

   1. Provide a plan with how you intend to make environmentally friendly decisions.

1. Diversity & Inclusion

   1. Provide a plan with how you intend to make your company & product both diverse and inclusive. 

   1. What does the future look like for both these options?

1. Ethics

   1. Provide a plan with how you intend to make both your company and product ethical.

## Design Documents

Design documentation is a collection of documents and resources that covers all aspects of your product design. Popular design documents include UI Mock-ups, UML Diagrams, CAD Models, Schematics, Sketches, and Product Renderings. **Please create and submit presentable design documents in your Google Drive.**

Below are some examples of design documents for an app and for a physical product:

## Resources for Design

There is also something called wireframing which would be amazing when demonstrating your product. Linked below is a long video showing how to use Figma and wireframe an app. You can skip through this to learn of find a shorter video. [HERE.](https://youtu.be/_jmFuGs5cPo)

Linked below are some good tools that can be used for both the design and presentation.

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
2. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
3. [TAMU Downloads](https://software.tamu.edu/public/AvailableSoftware.aspx)

## Product Refinement

Find a way to show your thought process throughout the product refinement phase. Look into Pugh Charts to do this as they're often used to compare different variations of your design against one another, finding the pros and cons to each. **Submit your Pugh Chart as part of the deliverables.**
