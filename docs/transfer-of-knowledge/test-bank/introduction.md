# Introduction

Howdy! Congrats on being elected as the next Director of Technical Affairs (or Project Lead)! This website will provide you with documentation to help you understand and use the different websites and systems we use for TAMU SHPE. It can be overwhelming to try and understand everything in the following section, but the good news is that the foundation has already been created. Your main deliverable will be to maintain all projects by fixing any bugs and keeping everything up to date. Although the constitution does not require it, you  are expected to think of innovative ways to improve Tech Affairs and TAMU SHPE as a whole.
