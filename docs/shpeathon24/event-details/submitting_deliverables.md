## File Upload

Throughout the course of the competition, several deliverables will need to be submitted. Each team will have their own folder inside of a shared google drive that they will need to upload completed files to. **Within your team folder, you will also have several folders for each phase. Make sure you submit the deliverables in their proper sub-folders!**

Be sure to follow the naming instructions for your files so we know what's what.

Use this Google Drive link to upload your files: [Google Drive](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aAfzbnV5SQwwayJb2fKGw5d4K5HLuV1V?usp=sharing__;!!KwNVnqRv!HsB8f_l3Z3L0rc__A5aS5hsPODmfQA9CSZrhzAybLsxnujqleUv-uZMZ73xTdVHMovY6L5Q-_PSTvG1ZnaiqEC8v$)
