# Deliverables

![TeamBuilding](/img/shpeathon-marketing.png)

Please answer the following questions relating to how you will market and advertise your company. ** Make sure to compile these answers and sections into a well-formatted document. **

1. What are sources that prove that your product functions the way you intend?
2. What other ways are you planning to use to promote and advertise your product?

## Consumer Input

Develop a method to analyze how your target audience responds to your product and their behavior as consumers. This could include a survey, discussion video, focus group, or similar approach. Reach out to friends, family, SHPEathon participants, SHPEathon volunteers/officers, and others for input.

**Submit your findings**, even if they are limited in scope.

Consider: Was the feedback what you expected? Is it valuable? How will you adjust your plans based on these insights?

## Logo & Slogan

Design a distinctive logo and a memorable slogan for your company. Generative AI use is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** for this task. Put in the effort to create something unique that reflects your companyâ€™s mission and vision.

## Social Media

Create a social media account with a description, profile picture, etc. You **must** make at least one post or short-form video. The account can be either public or private. If the account is private, **make sure to allow an officer or committee member to follow** in order to see the post/reel.
