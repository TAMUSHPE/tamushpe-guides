![Google Drive](/img/shpeathon-submission.jpeg)

## File Upload

Throughout the course of the competition, several deliverables will need to be submitted. Each team will have their own folder inside of a shared google drive that they will need to upload completed files to. **Within your team folder, you will also have several folders for each phase. Make sure you submit the deliverables in their proper sub-folders!**

Be sure to follow the naming instructions for your files so we know what's what.

Use this Google Drive link to upload your files: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XqT4QQzuWhKtcbupzybcm0QscWf-ezW3?usp=sharing)

**Make sure to submit your deliverables on time!**
