# ðŸ˜Š Introduction

For this part of the website, we will incorporate JavaScript for the first time. This section of the website will be the most challenging, so if you can please familiarize yourself with JavaScript a bit before beginning to implement the experiences section. I recommend watching [this quick JavaScript tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk "Quick JavaScript Tutorial") to get familiar with the language.

Once done watching the video, go ahead and create a new file in your main folder named __index.js__. This will be the file where you will write all your JavaScript. Next, at the end of your body tag in __index.html__, type the following:

``` html
<!-- DO NOT CODE AFTER HERE -->

<!-- Here are the bootstrap links -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.6/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-oBqDVmMz9ATKxIep9tiCxS/Z9fNfEXiDAYTujMAeBAsjFuCZSmKbSSUnQlmh/jp3" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-cuYeSxntonz0PPNlHhBs68uyIAVpIIOZZ5JqeqvYYIcEL727kskC66kF92t6Xl2V" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <!-- Type this tag -->
        <script src="index.js"></script>

    </body>
```

This will link __index.js__ to your html file and you will now be able to use the methods you write in your JavaScript file on your website!
