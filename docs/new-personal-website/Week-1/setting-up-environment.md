# ⚙️ Setting Up Your Environment

To set up for programming your personal website, you need to download two apps. VSCode will be the app you will use to write your code and Github will be used to document the work you do. To download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "VSCode Download"), click on the link. This should take you to a page that shows multiple download buttons, click the one that is most similar to your device. Afterwards, run the installer file and install VSCode.

For [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "Github Desktop Download"), click on the link. This will show you a download button that corresponds to your device, click on it, and run the installer to install the app. Once finished, you will need to make an account on Github for this to work. If you already have a Github account, great! You can skip the following section.
