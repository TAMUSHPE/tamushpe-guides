# ⬆️ Pushing to Github

To save your changes into Github, go to the leftmost sidebar in VSCode and press the following icon:

![Branch Icon](branch.png "Branch Icon")

When you have this, put a message that will remind you of what you did this week. A good example would be __"Week 1 PW Guide"__. After this, click the arrow next to commit and click __Commit & Push__. Once you do this, go to Github Desktop and verify that it was pushed properly.

Congratulations, you have just completed week 1 of making your own website!
