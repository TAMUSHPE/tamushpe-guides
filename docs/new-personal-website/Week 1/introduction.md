Welcome to TAMU SHPE's new Personal Website Guide! This guide will teach you how to make a website where you can show off your projects, previous internships, and things of that sort. You can even show off random skills like being good at Mario Kart and being able to do backflips! Jokes aside, having a personal website can make it easier for other people to learn more about you and will provide you with the skills required to create other types of web applications that you may want to create.

This guide will go over **HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.**
