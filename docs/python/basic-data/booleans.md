# Booleans
-Why do we use booleans? In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or false.

-Here is an example of booleans comparing two values.

```
print(20 > 3)
print(20 == 3)
print(20 < 3)

#Output: True
         False
         False

```

# If statements & booleans
-Here is another example while also using an if statement to show you how the two interact.

```
a = 100
b = 17

if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("b is not gretaer than a")

#Output: b is not greater than a

```
