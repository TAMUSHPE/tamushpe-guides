# Strings
-Strings are surronded by either single qouattions marks or double qouation makrs
-'Hello' is the same as "hello" and you display this by using the print() function.

Here is an examples

print('Hello')

#Output: Hello
         Hello
```

-With strings you can assingn a string to a vraible
```
a = "Hello"
print(a)

#output: Hello
```

# Concatenation
-String Concatenation basically means add strings together. Also use the " + " to add a variable to another variable. Down below we will provide you with an example to further solidify your understanding.

```
x = "Erick is"
y = "belligerent"
z = x + y

print(z)

#output: Erick is belligerent
```

# List of characters
-Here we will be disccusing 

-Using """ or ''' the three comma can help with assinging a mulitline string as follows.
```
a = """ I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god. I have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness."""

#Output: 
I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god. I have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness.
```
