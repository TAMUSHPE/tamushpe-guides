# Python Varaible and Types

-Variables are used for the purpose of storing data values, but here is the catch python does not have a command for storing variables. Instead, you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it

```
# An example showing you how to assign a variable
x = 10
y = "python"
print (x)
print (y)

#this would then output

>>> 10
    python
    
```

Now a variable is not confined to the value you have assigned it, but rather fluid and can change whenever you want the value of your variable to change (an example will be given showing this)


```
x = 10
x = "python"
print (x)

#this would output

>>> python
```
to get the data type of one of your variables simply use the [ type () ] function

```
x = 10
y = "python"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#output
>>> class 'int'
    class 'str'

```
