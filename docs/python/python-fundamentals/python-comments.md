# Comments

Have you ever had that moment where you just want to provide additional clarification or comments (wink wink) on something but you never get the chance to?  Thankfully with python and any other programming language you will encounter you always get that opportunity!

Comments are used to explain what your code is doing.  This helps peers who are viewing your code understand what it is you are trying to accomplish.  They are very important in group projects; you are gonna have them in ENGR 102 so start using comments!  Additionally, they help you understand your code in case you come back to it several months later and may have forgot what exactly your code is dong. 

Comments also can make code more readable for newcomers (They are really simple to make in Python!)

## Creating Comments

Here is one way to make comments in python by using # (and no it not a hash-tag)

```python
# Hello this is how you make a comment or whatever you would like to note
print("You'll get an A in this class!")
```

## Multi Line Comments

We can also make a comment block by using multiple # but that can get very tedious

```python
# Hi this is my 
# comment block
# but there is 
# a better way
```

To make a comment block, we can use double quotes " as shown below

```python
"""
Here is my super nice and 
awesome comment block.  Now
I don't have to use multiple #!
Hooray :)
"""
```
