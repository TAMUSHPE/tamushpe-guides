# Team Building

![TeamBuilding](/img/shpeathon-team-building.png)

## 👋 Introduction

Teamwork is undoubtedly one of the most essential aspects that can make or break a company. Not only is the word `"Company"` used to define a commercial business, but it also represents the presence of others who provide friendship and enjoyment. In this section, you and your teammates will share answers to questions we have provided with the goal of you all getting to know each other better.


## 🙋‍♀️ Questions

For each of these questions, have everyone on your team share their answer one by one. ** In your document, please include what your thoughts of each other were before and after answering the questions. What did you learn about each other?. ** 

```
1. What is your Hometown?

2. What are some of your interesting hobbies (past or present)?

3. What was your first job (or dream job)?

4. Share an embarrassing story.
```
