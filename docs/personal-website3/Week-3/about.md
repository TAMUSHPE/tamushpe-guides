# ü§µüèΩ About Me 

Now we have gotten to the section where you are really going to make this website your own. The about me section is a place where you can express yourself in a way that you probably are unable to do in your resume. However, please keep in mind to still keep it *appropriate* as you want to show this website to recruiters and/or future employers! This next section of your website will include a picture of you **(preferably a nice headshot)** and also a small blurb of who you are!

You can see the id="about-me" in the first div, this is what is linking the navbar to this section. Once you implement the following code you can go ahead and click on the navbar and it will slide down to your About Me section! This is where the id that you put in the navbar section really matters, so make sure **they are the same**.

Similarly, try and click that logo that we have the very left of the navbar. Now that we can scroll down, this logo will go up your website and take you back to your landing page! *This is because of the id="introduction" that we have at the beginning of the landing page section*. I just wanted to surprise you with it this week! ü§Øü§≠

## Once you like your picture and your text section, let's hop on over to the main.css!


Add the following to the bottom:

```css
/* -------------------------------- About Me Section -------------------------------- */

/* Makes the "About Me" section take up at minimum the entire height of the screen */
#about-me {
    padding: 85px 12vmin 0vmin 12vmin; 
    min-height: 100vmin;
}

#about-me p {
    margin-bottom: 0%;
}

/* Adds a color and weight to links in "About Me" */
.aboutMe-link {
    color: rgb(70, 170, 224);
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    font-weight: 600 !important;
}

/* Part of aboutMe-link, defines transformation type and timing */
#about-me a {
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

/* Gives a "popping" effect when hovering on links in "About Me" description */
#about-me a:hover {
    color: rgb(70, 170, 224);
    text-decoration: none;
    transform: scale(1.04);
}

/* Creates round-box with "About Me" description */
.aboutMe-box {
    border-radius: 15px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
    
    box-shadow: 4px 4px 12px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    transition: 0.4s;
}

/* Creates light white shadow around box on hover */
.aboutMe-box:hover {
    box-shadow: 4px 8px 24px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
}

/* Creates space inside of "About Me" box for description */
.about-spacing {
    padding: 3.5vmin 3.5vmin 3.5vmin 3.5vmin;
}

/* Formats text inside round-box */
.about-text {
    font-size: 1.1rem; /* 50px */
    color: var(--text-color);
    padding-bottom: 0%;
}

/* Puts a nice shadow around circular headshot */
.about-circle {
    height: 24vmax;
    width: 24vmax;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);

.about-circle:hover {
    box-shadow: 4px 8px 24px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
}

/* Styles/sizes the headshot */
.about-circle img {

    width: auto;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin: auto;
