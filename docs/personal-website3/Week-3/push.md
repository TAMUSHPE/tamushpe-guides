# ðŸ«¸Let's remember to push and commit!

Alright guys, at this point we know the drill. Lets commit and push these changes to our GitHub. If you forgot, don't worry just go to **Week-1** and go to the **Pushing to GitHub** tab. From here you can skip the first commit and push instructions since we have already done those and follow the steps after that.

Your websites at this point should be looking something like...

![How your website should look after week 3 (experience)](/img/new-pw/week-3-experience.png)

### Once you commit and push, you're all good for week 3!
