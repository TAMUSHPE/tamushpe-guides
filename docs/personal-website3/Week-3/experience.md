# üè¢ Experience

Alright this next section is for you to demonstrate any experience you have. This can be leadership positions, internships, summer jobs, etc. **Make it your own!**

I have below three blocks, for three different experience. Feel free to add or delete any. I really want this website to represent *you*. You can make it similar to what you have on your resume or elaborate more **(encouraged)**. You can see that I elaborate more on the first one and the difference from the 2nd and 3rd one. Have fun and demonstrate that passion and personality of yours!

Similar to the About Me, notice the id="experience" at the top of the code. Again, this links that navbar we made in Week 2 to this new section of your website!

```html
<!---------------------------------- Experience Section ---------------------------------->

	<div class="container-fluid" id="experience">

							<p>Incorporated technical drills and games into lesson plans for players aged 4 to 17. Kept players active while ensuring their well-being 
                                when temperatures were too high. Tailored lessons based on level of experience and the area of growth each player needed to improve. 
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>	
				</div>
				<!------------------- End of #3 ------------------->


			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
```

After this we just have to add a little bit more to the **main.css**.

```css
/* -------------------------------- Experience Section -------------------------------- */

/* Makes the "Experience" section take up at minimum the entire height of the screen */
#experience {
    padding-top: 85px; /* Changed 48vmin to 85px - 85px 12vmin 0vmin 12vmin */
    min-height: 100vmin;
}

/* Sets default styling for every <p> element in the "Experience" Section */
#experience p {
    font-size: 1.1rem; /* 50px */
    color: var(--text-color);
    padding-bottom: 0%;
    margin-bottom: 0%;
}
```

Now we are done with your experience section!!! ü•≥
