# ðŸ¤– Cloning Your Repository

First of all, what is a *repository*? In simple terms, it's a place where you keep all your files for project and that also keeps all the versions of your project. Meaning that if you update it but later want to access what it was like a year ago you can! 

![pretty cool](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExamtyNGJjaWhjNGp6b3M0dTJrbm02bWRreXF3Nzk0M3VhOXhkb2s2dyZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/OyDFFr0YAkeS3yBVJy/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

That either sounded mad cool or wack, but either way it's important for a personal website as we are going to display our websites using GitHub. 

First order of business, let's make a repository. Remember, **DO NOT USE GITHUB DESKTOP**. Go to GitHub website and log into your account. From there, on the top right corner of the screen look for a plus sign (+). Click that and then click 'New Repository'. Name the repository however you want that makes sense with your project. For instance, something like personal-website. **Make sure there are no spaces in your name**. 

Once the repository is made, there should be something in the middle that seems like a link. This is an HTTPS link that you can copy by clicking the copy button at the very right of the bar. 

Now, open **Visual Studio Code** and at the bottom where it says terminal type the following: 

**git clone personal-website .**

If your repository name is different than personal-website, type that instead.
