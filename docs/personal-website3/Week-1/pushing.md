# ðŸ“© Pushing to GitHub

Now that we have made changes to our repository, let's commit and push these changes. Go to the left hand side of VSCode and press the following icon:

![Branch Icon](/img/new-pw/branch.png "Branch Icon")

You are going to commit and push all the changes so make sure to stage all of them. To do this hover over "Changes" and press the + button. At the top of the tab write in the message what we did (Ex: Week 1 Website) and press commit. Then press sync changes which will push and pull from the origin.

### Congrats, you're done with Week 1! ðŸŽŠ
