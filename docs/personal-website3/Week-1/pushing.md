# ðŸ“© Pushing to GitHub

### Press that "Go Live" button at the bottom right of your screen to see what you have so far

#### Remember, it does not have to look like this, but this is a general outline of what you should have after completing your first week!

For our first push, we will perform a **very** important step: set upstream branch on git! Basically, this is saying we're creating a link from this *local* branch on your device to that of the *remote* branch in GitHub. 

To access your terminal: You can click on **View** on the top navbar of the screen, then **terminal** on the dropdown menu. Once we open the terminal, let's make sure we're in Powershell.

From here we will first stage all of our changes by typing in the following command:
```
git add .
```

After this, we must commit and add a comment to our commit:
```
git commit -m"First Commit"
```

Once we have done both of these steps were are now ready to do push our changes to GitHub:

```
git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>
```

Make sure to delete all of <branch name\> including <\> and put **main**. This should be the name of your branch unless you have created another branch.


### Pushing After Initial Push
After doing what I previously mentioned once, we can easily commit and push changes to our repository using the sidebar. Go to the left hand side of VSCode and press the following icon:

![Branch Icon](/img/new-pw/branch.png "Branch Icon")

You are going to commit and push all the changes so make sure to stage all of them. To do this hover over "Changes" and press the + button. At the top of the tab write in the message what we did (Ex: Week 1 Website) and press commit. Then press sync changes which will push and pull from the origin.

### Congrats, you're done with Week 1! ðŸŽŠ
