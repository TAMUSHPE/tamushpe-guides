# ðŸ§© Components

Your professional website will contain the following components, which will help demonstrate who you are as a person and what youâ€™ve accomplished as a student.

## Website Sections

- Navigation Bar
  - Must contain the home, about, projects, involvements, and resume pages as options
  - Must clearly be able to separate the â€˜activeâ€™ page from the rest
  - Must have a collapsible menu when the screen is reduced
  - Want to add a logo on your nav bar? It must be a png or other photo like file (could be your name)
- Home Page
  - Displays your name, school, and graduation year
  - Page is filled with an image that completely fills the screen
  - Navigation bar should remain on each page 
  - Have icons at the bottom of each page linking to your social mediaâ€™s. They should change to their distinctive colors when the user hovers over them
- About Page
  - Has an image carousel of images of yourself throughout your academic career
  - Has a summarized description of you (don't make it an essay)
  - Displays your interests and passions
  - Timeline of important events from your life
  - Have icons at the bottom of each page linking to your social mediaâ€™s. They should change to their distinctive colors when the user hovers over them
- Projects Page
  - Contains your projects and descriptions in reverse chronological order
  - The projects would be first seen in a small box with the name of the project, but then would expand out after pushing a â€˜learn moreâ€™ button. This will lead to a large description of the project.
    - Challenge: Instead of it being a small box, extends the image across the whole background. On top of this background image, add a colored filter. On top of that have a brief description of the project with a learn more button as well which gives a deeper understanding of what was accomplished
- Involvement Page
  - This page is similar to the projects page
  - Challenge: Instead of it being a small box, extends the image across the whole background. On top of this background image, add a colored filter. On top of that have a brief description of the organization with a learn more button as well which gives a deeper understanding of what you have done in the organizations
- Resume Page
  - This page will link the websites user to a pdf version of your most up to date resume
  - Page must open on a separate tab
