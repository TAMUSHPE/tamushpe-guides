# ðŸ¤¿ Let's dive deeper into HTML and CSS

In our **index.html** and **main.css** we are going to create ID's and classes. Now, what do each of them do and when should I use one or the other? That's a great question Diego, let's talk about it.

You use classes and IDs for the same purpose: you create something in your HTML file and then can change the appearance of that certain object with its class or ID. However, classes can be used multiple times while IDs can only be used once. Therefore, if you are creating something that you are only going to use once on your website, you should probably add the ID attribute rather than the class one. Classes are great for when you create a tile that you want to duplicate over and over again, let's say for your experience section. 

### Summary:
Classes - Great for items that you want to use the format again for.

IDs - Great for specific items that will only be needed once.
