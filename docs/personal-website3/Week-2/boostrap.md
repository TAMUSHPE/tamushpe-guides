# ðŸ¤¨ What is Bootstrap? 

We can think of Bootstrap as a helper when we're creating our personal websites. It basically holds a lot of information and layouts that we can play with to create our website how we want it to look. Most importantly, it allows us to make our websites look good on **mobile devices**!

We already imported Bootstrap in our websites in the *head* section of our index.html ðŸ˜²:

``` html
<!-- Importing bootstrap css -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

With this single line of code we can now access and utilize Bootstrap!

Bootstrap works on a grid system, and if you want to read more about it you can follow the link below that explains everything more in detail:

The part of bootstrap that we are really going to be utilizing are the containers. We can use the containers to easily group together parts of our html and change them within our css using bootstrap. Containers are very useful for creating a responsive website!
