## File Upload

Throughout the course of the competition, several deliverables will need to be submitted. Each team will have their own folder inside of a shared google drive that they will need to upload completed files to. **Within your team folder, you will also have several folders for each phase. Make sure you submit the deliverables in their proper sub-folders!**

Be sure to follow the naming instructions for your files so we know what's what. It is up to you how you decide to submit your files, just make sure to include everything and name everything accordingly.
