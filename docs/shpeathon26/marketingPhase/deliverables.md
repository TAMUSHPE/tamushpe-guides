# Deliverables

![TeamBuilding](/img/shpeathon-marketing.png)

Please answer the following questions relating to how you will market and advertise your company. ** Make sure to compile these answers and sections into a well-formatted document and submit to the drive under the Marketing section. **

1. What are sources that prove that your product functions the way you intend?
2. What other ways are you planning to use to promote and advertise your product?

## Consumer Input

Develop a method to analyze how your target audience responds to your product and their behavior as consumers. This could include a survey, discussion video, focus group, or similar approach. Reach out to friends, family, SHPEathon participants, SHPEathon volunteers/officers, and others for input.

**Submit your findings**, even if they are limited in scope.

Consider: Was the feedback what you expected? Is it valuable? How will you adjust your plans based on these insights?

If you are not able to collect direct consumer input, why? How would your audience react if you could collect this input? 

**All of your findings, including any considerations should be submitted.**

## Logo & Slogan

Design a distinctive logo and a memorable slogan for your company. Generative AI use is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** for this task. To earn full points, make sure to submit **PROOF** that your logo and slogan is **NOT** AI generated. Put in the effort to create something unique that reflects your company’s mission and vision.

## Social Media

Create a social media account with a description, profile picture, etc. You **must** make at least one post in the form of a short-form video. Feel free to include more posts as this may result in bonus points. The account can be either public or private. If the account is private, **make sure to allow an officer or committee member to follow** in order to see the post.
