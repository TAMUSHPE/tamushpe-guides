![Finance](/img/shpeathon-finance.png)

## Company Structure

Include a document outlining the hierarchical structure of your company, detailing any potential teams and departments, their purposes, and the chain of command. Additionally, provide a visual representation of your company's 5-year plan.

The specifics of this visual are up to you to decide. A good example of what your company could look like can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FatwsLNKi8cDD_8AM8h4u5nBmgbUzkSm-fJNcAI-Rdk/edit?usp=sharing)

## General Questions

Please answer the following questions relating to how you will raise and allocate money for your company. ** Please compile these answers into a well-formatted document. **

1. How will you get funding to kickstart your company? **Provide multiple sources**. A good company never relies on one method of funding. **Include a pie chart** in your document that details where your funding comes from
2. How much will it cost to create the product and how much will it cost the consumer? Be sure to back up your answer with evidence and sources.
3. How will you maintain clear and effective communication between different teams or departments within your company?
4. What potential risks have you identified in your company’s operations and how will you address them?


## Budget & Earnings

Include a spreadsheet that outlines the budget and potential earnings for your company over the course of a year. Make sure to **incorporate any potential cost and revenue stream** including costs due to marketing. Your budget should be a detailed rough estimate, but make sure to provide sources. The structure of the spreadsheet is up to you. 

**The more details that are on your budget, the higher the chances of you earning a better score.** This is where you really show us that your product/idea is possible, as for everything to exist, it all has to line up financially.
