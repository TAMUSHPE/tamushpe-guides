# Brainstorming & Deliverables

![TeamBuilding](/img/shpeathon-design-2.jpeg)

## Product Planning

A mind map is a visual tool that helps you organize and connect ideas around a central concept. It is a brainstorming diagram that starts with the main idea in the center and branches out with related topics or qualities of your product.

Create your own mind map and **submit the image file into the google drive**.

## Description of Product

**Add a brief description of your product in a seperate section, make sure to mention what makes it reliable, inclusive, and ethical.**

* Impact

   - What is the global impact of your product?

* Ethics

   - What systems will you implement to ensure your company and product remain ethical as they grow?
   - How will you make sure that your product influences human impact rather than influencing humans themselves?



## Design Documents

Design documentation is a collection of documents and resources that covers all aspects of your product design. Popular design documents include UI Mock-ups, UML Diagrams, CAD Models, Schematics, Sketches, and Product Renderings.

For this deliverable, you are required to create **one** draft design of your website landing page and **one** design document, the second of which must be included in your sales pitch. You may include additional design documents for evaluation if desired.

**Upload everything for this phase as one document in the Google Drive when finished**

Below are some examples of design documents for an app and for a physical product:

There is also something called wireframing which would be amazing when demonstrating your product. Linked below is a long video showing how to use Figma and wireframe an app. You can skip through this to learn of find a shorter video. [HERE.](https://youtu.be/_jmFuGs5cPo)

Linked below are some good tools that can be used for both the design and presentation.
