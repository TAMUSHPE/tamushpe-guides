# Introduction

![Design](/img/shpeathon-design.jpeg)

## Phase Description 

The Design Phase provides your team with the opportunity to explore all potential paths to creating your product. Throughout this phase, you will plan and refine the details of the product.

Many of the items you will design here will be going into your **one slide** sales pitch presentation on Saturday at 11:30 AM in ETB 1034. The sales pitch has a maximum run-time of **two minutes** and is a key part of your final competition score. There should be **no financial information** in your sales pitch. You will be docked points if you discuss finances during this stage.
