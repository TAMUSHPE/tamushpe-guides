![TeamBuilding](/img/shpeathon-design-2.jpeg)

## Product Planning

Research different types of documents that will help your team brainstorm ideas. Choose one and and on paper (or digitally). Submit this document. Examples:
   1. Mind Map type of document
   2. Be creative and create your own
   3. Anything else that conveys ideas & thought process

## Design Documents

Design documentation is a collection of documents and resources that covers all aspects of your product design. Popular design documents include UI Mock-ups, UML Diagrams, CAD Models, Schematics, and Product Renderings. Please create and submit presentable design documents in your Google Drive. Below are some examples of design documents I created when designing the MemberSHPE Portal:
