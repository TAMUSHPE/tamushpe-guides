# Percent Yield

In an actual reaction, the amount of product formed is usually less than predicted from stoichiometry. This is because -
1. Side reactions may form unwanted products.
1. The reaction may not go to completion even if some of both reactants are left over.

**Theoretical yield:** amount of maximum product `calculated` from the reaction.

**Actual yield:** the amount of product `obtained` from the reaction.
