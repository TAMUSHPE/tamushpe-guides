# Gibbs Free Energy

`Gibbs Free Energy (∆G)` is the energy that is available to do **useful work** in a spontaneous process (∆G < 0) or the work that is required to drive a non-spontaneous (∆G > 0) process. Heat energy cannot be completely transferred into work energy due to entropy. 

* The formula is: **∆G = ∆H - T∆S**

For example:

* When a reaction is **exothermic** and the **disorder increases**, the reaction is -
    * Exothermic means ∆H° < 0.
    * Disorder increases means ∆S° > 0.
    * Looking at the equation ∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°, we can conclude that  ∆G° < 0 for all values of T. Therefore, the reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures.

* When a reaction is **exothermic** and the **disorder decreases**, the reaction is -
    * Exothermic means ∆H° < 0.
    * Disorder decreases means ∆S° < 0.
    * Looking at the equation ∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°, we can conclude that  ∆G° < 0 for small values of T. Therefore, the reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures and not spontaneous at high temperatures.

## Calculating Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)

The formula to calculate Gibbs Free Energy is: 

* **∆G°<sub>rxn</sub> = 𝚺 n ∆G°<sub>f(products)</sub> - 𝚺 m ∆G°<sub>f(reactants)</sub>**

N and m are the stoichiometric coefficients of each product or reactant.

Similar to ∆S, If a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, **∆G** for the overall reaction will be **equal to the sum of the ∆G’s** for the individual steps.

## Crossover Temperature

When the equation ∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S° is at equilibrium,  ∆G = 0. This point is the crossover of two lines as shown in the diagram below. The temperature at this crossover is usually the boiling point or melting point.
