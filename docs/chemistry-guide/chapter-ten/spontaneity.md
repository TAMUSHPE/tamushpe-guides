# Spontaneity

**Spontaneous** processes occur without any ongoing outside intervention and are **irreversible**.

![Spontaneity Example](/img/spontaneous-example.png)

A process may be spontaneous at one temperature and non-spontaneous at another temperature. 
For example, imagine a glass of ice placed in a temperature-controlled room. 

![Spontaneity Temperature Example](/img/spontaneous-temperature.png)

In the first scenario, the room has a temperature above 0°C (room temperature). In this room, the glass of ice will melt into liquid water (spontaneous process). 
In the second scenario, the room has a temperature below 0°C. In this, room the glass of ice stays as a glass of ice unless you purposely heat up the glass to melt the ice (a non-spontaneous process because you added work).

> Spontaneous processes may be either **endothermic** (energy absorbed from surroundings) or **exothermic** (energy released into surroundings).
