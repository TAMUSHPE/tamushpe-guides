# Kelvin Scale and Pressure

![Kelvin Scale](/img/kelvin.jpg)

In chemistry, you will most often be using either celsius or kelvin for your temperature units. When dealing with gas, kelvin is used almost exclusively. The Kelvin scale is actually known as the absolute temperature scale, where absolute zero in Kelvin is equal to -273.15 °C. One unit of Kelvin is equal to one unit of °C. Converting between the two is easy and straightforward.

* To go from Celsius to Kelvin, subtract 273.15.
* To go from Kelvin to Celsius, add 273.15.

## Pressure

There are many different units of measurement when it comes to pressure. The main 2 are atm (atmospheres of pressure) and pascals. The conversion chart is shown above and outlines many different units of measurement for pressure, all used for unique applications.
