# Ions

![Cation and Anion Image](/img/chemistry/cation-anion.png)

There are several types of ions, and most are formed when atoms lose or gain electrons. The main 2 types of ions are `monatomic ions` and `polyatomic ions`. Ions are then classified by whether they have a positive charge or negative charge, leaving them classified as either a `cation` or `anion`.

## Classifying Ions

Monatomic ions are charged particles that form when a single atom gains or loses one or more electrons. An example would be Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup> etc.

Polyatomic ions on the other hand are a group of atoms that carry an electrical charge. Examples include ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, CN<sup>-</sup> etc.

Beyond being classified as monatomic or polyatomic, an ion is also referred to as either a cation or anion. 
* `Cations (+)` are positively charged monatomic or polyatomic ions, which have more protons than electrons. 
    * Add -ion to the end of monatomic cations.
    * Ex. Sodium -> Sodium Ion, Na<sup>+</sup>
* `Anions (-)` on the other hand, are negatively charged monatomic or polyatomic ions. This means that anions have a negative charge and more electrons than protons.
    * Add -ide to end of monatomic anions.
    * Ex. Chlorine -> Chloride, Cl<sup>-</sup>
