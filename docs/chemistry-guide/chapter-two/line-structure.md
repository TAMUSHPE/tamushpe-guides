# Line Structure

![](/img/chemistry/line-structure.jpg)

Line structures are visual representations of organic compounds (compounds containing carbon). Carbon and the hydrogen atoms attached are not shown explicitly.

There are 2 important generalizations/rules with line structures related to chemical bonding -

1. A hydrogen atom in an organic molecule/compound can form only one covalent bond to one other atom.

1. Every carbon atom in an organic molecule/compound always forms exactly 4 covalent bonds.
    1. Double lines represent double bonds.
