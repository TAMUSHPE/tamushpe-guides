# Dimensional Analysis

Dimensional analysis is a very useful method of converting units from one system to another. In chemistry, this will be the main use of dimensional analysis. An example of this would be converting distance from the imperial system to the metric system.

![Dimensional Analysis Example]()

<!-- This isn't centered, requires ${}$ for chemistry -->
${CO2 + C -> 2CO}$

<!-- Centered using $$ -->
$${CO2 + C -> 2 CO}$$
