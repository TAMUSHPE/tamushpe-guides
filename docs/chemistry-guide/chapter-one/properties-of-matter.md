# Properties of Matter

Matter has many characteristics, whether it's the state it's in, the changes occuring to it, or how it's mixed.

## Physical vs. Chemical

Physical and chemical changes are similar to one another, but are very different at the molecular level. Physical changes are mostly visual, as they do not alter chemical bonds of the object involved nor create new substances. 

Take for example chopping wood, this change is physical because the wood still has the same molecular properties as it did before. The only difference is that there are now multiple pieces of wood because it was chopped.

<!-- Additionally, most mixtures are created as a result of a physical change, meaning that they can be reverted later on. -->

Chemical changes on the other hand, are more complex and not so easily identifiable nor differentiable from physical changes. However, there are 5 indicators that can be used to make distinguishing the two easier.

1. Burning or fire is present
1. The temperature changes without outside heating nor cooling
1. An explosion occurs
1. There's a change in color
1. There are fizzing bubbles or there's a change in odor

An example of this would be a nail rusting, as a chemical reaction is taking place between the iron in the nail, water from outside sources, and the oxygen in the atmosphere.

## States of Matter

There are several states of matter,
