# de Broglie Wavelength

![de Broglie Wavelength Formula](/static/img/de-broglie-wavelength.jpg)

The de Broglie Wavelength and mass of an object are inversely proportional, as the mass of the object increases its corresponding wavelength decreases.

## Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle

This principle states that it is impossible to both know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time with reasonable accuracy. The uncertainty in position for lighter objects is relatively large, while the uncertainty in position for heavier objects is relatively small.
