# Bohr Model and Electronic Structure

![Bohr Model Image](/img/chemistry/bohr-atom.png)

In the Bohr Model, electrons are depicted as orbiting the nucleus in levels. Additionally, there are two distinct states that can exist within each atom or molecule.

## Energy Transitions and States

The two states that exist within the Bohr model of the atom are the `ground state` and the `excited state`. The ground state refers to the lowest energy state of an atom, while the excited state refers to an atom absorbing energy and its electrons being promoted to a higher energy orbital. 

![Energy Transition Diagram](/img/chemistry/energy-transitions.png)

The process of an atom obtaining energy and promoting electrons to outer orbitals is called `absorption`, where the atom aquires or "absorbs" photons. For example, when an atom gains energy through photons, its electrons may jump from the n = 1 orbital up to the n = 2 orbital. This excited state, however, cannot exist forever due to the electrons losing that energy and transitioning back down to ground state through a process known as `emission`. In emission, an atom releases or "emits" photons or energy and transitions back down to the original ground state.

The emission and/or absorption wavelengths can be calculated using the formulas shown above, alongside the energy it may take to transition from different orbital levels.

<!--  

Absorption = Ground state -> Excited State (Acquires or "absorbes" electrons)

Emission = Excited state -> Ground State (Releases or "emits" electrons)

Emission and absorption wavelengths can be calculated using E = hv

^Ex. **Find the energy emitted from going from the N = 4 energy level to the N = 2 energy level.**

^Solution. For energy transitions, identify the transition stages or wavelengths given. So if there is a transition given from N = 4 to N = 1 calcualte the energy emitted from that using the given wavelength. If a transition is given from N = 2 to N = 1 calcualte the energy emitted in this respective transition using the given wavelength. Once you have both quantities you subtract the energy associated with 2 -> 1 from the larger 4 -> 1 transition, giving you the energy emitted going from N = 4 to N = 2!
