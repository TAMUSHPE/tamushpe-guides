# Bohr Model and Electronic Structure

Absorption = Ground state -> Excited State (Acquires or "absorbes" electrons)

Emission = Excited state -> Ground State (Releases or "emits" electrons)

Emission and absorption wavelengths can be calculated using E = hv

^Ex. **Find the energy emitted from going from the N = 4 energy level to the N = 2 energy level.**

^Solution. For energy transitions, identify the transition stages or wavelengths given. So if there is a transition given from N = 4 to N = 1 calcualte the energy emitted from that using the given wavelength. If a transition is given from N = 2 to N = 1 calcualte the energy emitted in this respective transition using the given wavelength. Once you have both quantities you subtract the energy associated with 2 -> 1 from the larger 4 -> 1 transition, giving you the energy emitted going from N = 4 to N = 2!
