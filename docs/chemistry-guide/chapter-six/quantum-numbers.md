# Quantum Numbers & Atomic Orbitals

![Quantum Numbers Example](/static/img/electron-configuration.jpg)

Over many years, flaws were found within the Bohr model. Schrodinger then came up with another model which instead of having distinct levels, contained a density map with probabilities of where electrons could be at a certain point in time.

## Quantum Numbers

Orbitals are what describe the specific distribution of electron density in space. There are 4 primary quantum numbers that describe orbitals. These include the following.

1. Principal Quantum Number
    - Denoted by *n*.
    - Value can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - Determines shell and the average distance from the nucleus.
    - Defines the energy level of the electron in the orbital.

1. Angular Momentum Quantum Number
    - Denoted by *l*.
    - Value can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
        - 0 -> s = "sharp", has a spherical shape with just 1 orbital.
        - 1 -> p = "principal", has a dumbell shape with 3 orbitals.
        - 2 -> d = "diffuse", has a cloverleaf shape with 5 orbitals.
        - 3 -> f = "fundamental", has no definite shape but has 7 orbitals.
    - This defines the shape of orbitals.

1. Magnetic Quantum Number
    - Denoted by *m<sub>l</sub>*.
    - Value ranges from -*l* to *l*.
        - If *l* = 2, then *m<sub>l</sub>* could be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.
    - This defines the orientation of the orbital.

1. Magnetic Spin Quantum Number
    - Denoted by *m<sub>s</sub>*.
    - The value of spin can only ever be +1/2 or -1/2.
        - +1/2 indicates spin up.
        - -1/2 indicates spin down.

<!-- Maybe add number of orbitals per type - "subshell" (s vs. p vs. d) This is within Angular Momentum dropdown -->

## Atomic Orbitals

![Quantum Number Chart](/static/img/quantum-numbers-diagram.jpg)

The diagram above serves as a visual representation of Quantum Numbers and shows the relevance of atomic orbitals.

Electrons reside within these atomic orbitals, with up to 2 electrons fitting in each orbital. When an orbital is double occupied or "full", the electrons within the orbitals must have opposite spins.

The total number of orbitals in an electron shell is equal to *n*<sup>2</sup>, while the number of orbitals in a given subshell is equivalent to (2*l* + 1).

> Note - The maximum number of electrons is equal to 2*n*<sup>2</sup>.

<!-- 

Each orbital can hold 2 electrons, one +1/2 spin and the other -1/2 spin. The orbitals are one 1s, one 2s three 2p, one 3s three 3p five 3d, and then one 4s three 4p five 4d and seven 4f orbitals.

Each orbital can hold 2 electrons so remember this when going back and trying to re-learn how to designate sub-shells ("n"), and letter naming's based on the number of electrons within the atom or element being looked at.

Refer to Slide 78 and end there for this slide, the rest goes into the Electrons and Rules slide.
