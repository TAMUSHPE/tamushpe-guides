# Rate Laws

![Rate Laws General Formula](/img/rate-laws.png)

Rate laws essentially use concentration and relate it to the reaction rate.

The general formula is shown above, with several variables included.

* `k` - This is a constant which depends on temperature, it is large for reactions with a fast rate. The units themselves vary depending on the reaction order.

* `n, m` - These 2 variables represent reaction orders, they have no correlation to the actual coefficients of the original equation. The **overall reaction order is defined by n + m**.

* `a, b, c, d` - These represent the actual coefficients of the original equation.

* `A, B, C, D` - These variables represent the elements or molecules that are used in the equation.

## Reaction Order

![Different Order Reactions](/img/reaction-orders.png)

There are several orders of reaction, varying from 0<sup>th</sup> order up until the i<sup>th</sup> order. The most common you'll find are 0<sup>th</sup> order, 1<sup>st</sup> order, and 2<sup>nd</sup> order.

Each of these different ordered reactions relies on the value of n. The higher the order goes, the quicker the reaction takes place.

* 0<sup>th</sup> order reactions are linear in nature, they are constant and have a straight slope throughout.

## Example

![Rate Law Example](/img/rate-law-ex.PNG)

In the example above, you're asked to find the rate law of the equation. There are 2 parts to this because you need both `n` and `m` in order to find the overall reaction order.

So to do this you first have to find the ratio of 2 different rates, along with the ratio of 2 different molarities of 2 respective molecules/elements. In doing this you cancel out the `k` constant, and factor out the `n`, leaving you with a simplified equation. To find `n` value, you then solve by plugging in the given values and finding that `n` = 2.

In the 2nd part of the question, you're asked to find the order of O<sub>2</sub>. To find this, you need to again go through the same process as above. The resulting answer is `m` = 1, which when combined with `n` gives the overall reaction order which is 3!

> Note: The answer is B) First order, because it asks what the order of O<sub>2</sub> was and not the overall reaction order.
