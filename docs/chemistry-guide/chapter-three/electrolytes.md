# Electrolytes

![Electrolyte Comparison](/img/chemistry/electrolyte-comparison.jpg)

Electrolytes are substances that, when dissolved in water, conduct electricity. Non-electrolytes are substances that don't conduct electricity when dissolved in water.

## Strong and Weak Electrolytes

![Solubility Chart](/img/chemistry/solubility-chart.jpg)

There are 2 kinds of electrolytes, strong and weak. Strong electrolytes exist in solutions and tend to completely dissociate and break down into ions. The following are strong electrolytes - 
* All strong soluble salts (shown above)
* All strong acids (HCl, HBr, HI, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H2SO<sub>4</sub>,HClO<sub>4</sub>)
* All strong bases (NaOH, LiOH, KOH, ~Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>)

Weak electrolytes on the other hand are solutes that exist in solutions mostly in the form of molecules (they don't completely dissociate into ions).
* All weak acids (HF, HC2H3O2, [see table](/docs/chemistry-guide/chapter-three/acids-and-bases.md))
* All weak bases (NH3, [see table](/docs/chemistry-guide/chapter-three/acids-and-bases.md))
