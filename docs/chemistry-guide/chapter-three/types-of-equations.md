# Types of Equations

There are 3 main forms of chemical equations. The 

![Molecular Equation](/img/molecular-equation.jpg)

Molecular equations show all substances as molecular formulas, keeping compounds/molecules together and displaying the physical states of the molecules.

![Total Ionic Equation](/img/total-ionic-equation.jpg)

Total Ionic equations show all ions and molecules, including spectator ions. Spectator ions are on both sides of the equation and are non-active participants in the reaction.

> In the case above, the spectator ion is NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (aq)

![Net Ionic Equation](/img/net-ionic-equation.jpg)

Net Ionic equations show only the ions and molecules that participate, so spectator ions are emitted.

> In the example above, the spectator ions are NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (aq) and K<sup>+</sup> (aq) which are ommitted from the Net Ionic Equation.
