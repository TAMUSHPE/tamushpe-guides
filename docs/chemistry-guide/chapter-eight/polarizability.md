# Polarizability

Polarizability is a large factor in determining how greatly a molecule is affected by dispersion forces. The heavier a molecule is, the more polarizable it is. As a result, this means that the molecule itself will experience stronger dispersion forces.

## Miscibility

![Miscible Example](/img/chemistry/miscibile.jpg)

This property describes 2 substances that are mixable together. Something may be miscible if it can dissolve in another substance.

For example, like dissolves like -

* Polar molecules are miscible with polar molecules.
* Non-polar molecules are miscible with non-polar molecules.
* Polar molecules are **not** miscible with non-polar molecules.
