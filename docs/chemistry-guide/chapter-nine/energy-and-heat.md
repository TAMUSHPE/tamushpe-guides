# Energy & Heat

![Energy Formula](/img/chemistry/change-in-energy.jpg)

Energy is the capacity to do work (denoted by `w`) or transfer heat (denoted by `q`). Usually, energy is measured in Joules or Calories.

Before talking about what ∆E is (as shown above), it's important to understand what a system is and what the surroundings are.
* A system is the object being studied or the focus of the problem.
* The surroundings are everything else outside of this system/object.

∆E represents the change in energy, and the sign of this is very important. 
* Whenever ∆E is negative, energy is lost to the surroundings. 
* When ∆E is positive, however, energy is gained from the surroundings.

## State & Path Functions

![State vs. Path](/img/chemistry/state-vs-path.jpg)

To describe a process, it is usually called a `state` or `path` function.

* State functions are dependent on the initial and final states of a system.
    * Typically represented by uppercase variables.
    * Ex. V, E, P, T
* Path functions on the other hand are dependent on the path that a system takes to get from the initial to the final state.
    * They are represented by lowercase variables.
    * Ex. q, w, t, d
