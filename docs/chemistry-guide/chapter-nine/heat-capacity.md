# Heat Capacity

![Heat Capacity Example](/img/specific-heat.jpg)

This property, heat capacity, is largely important in thermodynamics and in both this and the next chapter. 

## Specific & Molar Heat Capacity

When referring to the specific heat capacity of a substance or an object, it means the amount of `heat (q)` required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance/object by 1 degree Celsius. This is shown by an uppercase `C`.
* An example can be shown by water (H<sub>2</sub>O), which has a specific heat capacity of approximately 4.184 J/gÂ°C.
* An interesting trend shows that metals have a lower specific heat, meaning that it's easier to change the temperature of a metal.

Molar heat capacity on the other hand (represented by C<sub>m</sub>) is similar to specific heat capacity. The main difference is that this is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a substance by 1 degree Celsius.

> Note: Temperature is different from heat.

## First Law of Thermodynamics

Energy can be transferred from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total energy in the universe is constant.
