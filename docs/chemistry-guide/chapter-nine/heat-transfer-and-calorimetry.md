# Heat Transfer & Calorimetry

![Heat Transfer Equation](/img/q-mcat.png)

The formula shown above is one of the most common you will see throughout this chapter, it connects heat, mass, specific heat, and temperature change.

## Heat Transfer

When it comes to heat transfer, specific heat plays a large role in the amount of heat/energy required to change the temperature of a substance/object.

* High-specific heat
    * Takes lots of heat to change the temperature by 1°C.

* Low specific heat
    * Takes little heat to change the temperature by 1°C

The equation shown above is used fairly often, and it's important to note that the q<sub>system</sub> = - q<sub>surroundings</sub> and vice versa.

## Calorimetry

Calorimetry itself is an experimental technique used to measure the heat flow into or out of a thermodynamic system. What this means is it basically measures the change in heat.

Another important thing to note is that q<sub>reaction</sub> = - q<sub>calorimeter</sub>. There are 2 main kinds of Calorimetry, coffee cups, and bomb calorimetry.

### Coffee cup calorimetry

These types of calorimetry have their independent formulas and vary slightly as shown above for the coffee cup.

### Bomb Calorimetry

The above image shows the different formulas that can be used when dealing with bomb calorimeters.
