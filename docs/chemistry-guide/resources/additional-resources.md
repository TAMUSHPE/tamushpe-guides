## Study tips for Quizzes/Exams

- When preparing for quizzes, make sure to redo past homework through OWL for practice and look over notes so you understand conceptual topics!
- For exams it's also good to utilize past quizzes and OWL homework as practice.
    - If you missed a question on a quiz, make sure to figure out why and redo the problem so you don't miss a similar question.
    - Make sure to attend review sessions that may be offered by TA's or professors themselves as well.
    - Most importantly, try to do at least a few practice exams to prepare.
