This guide will aid you throughout your CHEM 107 journey by providing insight as to what will be taught in this course alongside the topics you should focus and prioritize on. Additionally, this guide will serve as a great resource to look back on after completing 107!

The sections in this guide will be laid out according to your syllabus, with each section representing a chapter. Within these chapters there will be sub-sections that'll go into greater detail on the material to help you best understand and learn chemistry!
